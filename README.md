Competitive Adsorption Calibration Tool
Overview
This tool is designed to automatically batch-correct the equilibrium concentrations of components in competitive adsorption systems. By improving the accuracy of the calculated adsorption amounts and selectivity factors, it enhances the overall precision of adsorption modeling.

Key Features
Automatic Batch Calibration
The tool automatically batch-calculates and corrects the equilibrium concentrations of multiple components involved in competitive adsorption, improving the accuracy of adsorption amount and selectivity factor calculations.

Iterative Update Strategy
The calibration process employs an iterative updating strategy, ensuring that the corrected concentrations closely match the concentration changes in the original solution caused by the adsorption of components.

Batch Calculation of Adsorption Amount and Selectivity Factors
While correcting the equilibrium concentrations of multiple components, the tool simultaneously calculates the adsorption amounts and selectivity factors for each component in the system.

Multi-Component Adsorption System Correction
The tool integrates functionality for correcting multi-component adsorption systems, making it adaptable to a variety of scenarios and use cases.
